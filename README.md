# Image visuallyzer App

A visuallyzer image app which is created to showcase images without any restrictions and scaled perfectly with own api

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/vasa-r/Labellerr
```

Go to client (frontend)

```bash
  cd client
```

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/vasa-r/Labellerr
```

Go to server (backend) - not recommended because images are stored in personal mongoDB, so simply go to client and proceed

```bash
  cd server
```

## Features

- Scalable Grid: Display images in a grid, ensuring performance optimization.
- Infinite Scroll: Implement infinite scrolling to load images progressively as the user scrolls down.
- Dynamic Resizing: The grid should dynamically adjust the number of columns and image sizes based on the screen size and orientation. (NOT RESPONSIVE)
